# python-basics

This is a set of Python programs that perform various tasks and functions to demonstrate the basics of the
language. Each file has a title that indicates the task; the Table of Contents (0.ToC.md) and comments within
explain which concepts are being demonstrated by the program.

Each file is just the program script, which can be copied and pasted into IDLE or another Python processor to
be executed, so the results of running the program can be viewed.

tools.py contains several important functions and codeblocks that can be imported for use in other programs.
