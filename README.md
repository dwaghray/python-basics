# python-basics

This is a set of Python programs that perform various tasks and functions to demonstrate the basics of the
language. Each file has a title that indicates the task; and the comments within explain which concept(s) is 
being demonstrated by the program.

Each file is just the program script, which can be copied and pasted into IDLE or another Python processor to
be executed, so the results of running the program can be viewed.
